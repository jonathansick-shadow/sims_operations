# Calculate random downtime using following probabilities:
#	minor event (remainder of night and next day) = 5/365 days
#		e.g. power supply failure
#       intermediate (3 nights) = 2/365 days
#		e.g. repair filter mechanism, rotator, hexapod, or shutter
#	major event (7 nights) = 1/2*365 days
#	catastrophic event (14 nights) = 1/3650 days
#		e.g. replace a raft
#
#  USAGE: ./randomDown.py > <filename>
#       To emit a configuration file for random downtime in OpSim, I usually
#       take the median of 10 random runs.
